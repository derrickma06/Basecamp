## How to set up environment

Clone the repository and be on the "dev" branch.

Ensure you have Docker Desktop installed.
Navigate to the scripts folder in the terminal using ```cd scripts``` and run the start-dev script with ```./start-dev```

Once the containers are built and running, in your browser go to http://localhost:3000
